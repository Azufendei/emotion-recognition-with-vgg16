# Realtime-Emotion-Recognition-With-VGG16
This project was made with the motivation of getting down the fundamental basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
The model was trained on the FER2013 Dataset.
VGG16 is a pre-trained facial recognition neural network architecture available on Keras. The project utilises this architecture..
Activation Function -> Softmax.
Loss Function -> Categorical Crossentropy.
Optimizer -> Adam.
Also uses early stopping mechanism to avoid overfitting.
Final accuracy achieved -> 0.52~.
